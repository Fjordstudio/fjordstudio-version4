# fjordstudio-version4
This is the fourth version of fjordstudio.dk - due in November 2019.

This is a custom Wordpress theme - it is geared towards being as well an online resume, as a freelancer profile. 

As a bonus, I've added a blog to the site in order to express my views and experience in webdesign and UX - instead of just showing off the cases I have worked on.

The design is completely new and altogether different from what I previously used. It is sleek - it is more modern - makes better use of UI animation - and first and foremost, it uses whitespace and emphasises typography in ways I used to think I'd never know how to do.

Also, the site content has been written / re-written / translated in(to) Danish, instead of remaining in English.
- In the future, I hope to make the site multilingual instead.
